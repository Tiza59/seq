The program 'cs' calculates the number of representations of n as a sum of
between 2 and 5 cubes, for n in the range 1 to max^3, where 'max' is the
argument supplied when running the program.

Results are written to the files "x2" .. "x5" as a stream of bytes such that
the first byte is the number of representations of 1. As such, the counts
are capped at 255.

The code is designed to be easy to adapt for variations, such as to remove
the cap, or sum different things.
