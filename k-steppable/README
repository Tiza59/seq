How many of the b^n strings of length n, base b can be partitioned in at least
one way into k non-empty substrings such that the substrings appear in lexical
order?

Code calculates the two 3-argument functions good(b, k, n) and bad(b, k, n)
which represent the count of the b^n strings that (respectively) can and
cannot be partitioned in at least one such way.
