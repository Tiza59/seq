=head1 A337663 - stepping stone puzzle

a(n) is the greatest number that can be inscribed in an infinite square
grid under the following rules:
- the grid is initialized by writing 1 into n arbitrarily placed squares
- thereafter numbers k = 2, 3 ... are placed into empty squares in order
  such that at the point of placement the non-empty squares among its
  eight neighbours sum to k.

In implementation, we place the 1s in arrears, placing only as many as
are needed to allow the next value of k to be placed.

my($n) = shift(@ARGV) // 2;

if ($n >= 9) {
    die "Can't yet calculate $n >= 9, need to be able to coalesce more than"
        . " 2 groups simultaneously";
}

my $board = Board->new(2, $n, []);
my($max, $max_board) = $board->try(1, $board);
print "a($n) = $max ($Board::count)\n";
print $max_board->str, "\n";
